<div class="well">
	<p>According to the Australian Bureau of Statistic (ABS), almost
		one-third of households in Australia rent their homes. As a long-term
		renter in the Brisbane area I have experienced some very good service
		and some very poor service from rental agencies.</p>
	<p>An important part of the rental process is filling out the
		application form. Prospective tenants are required to declare a huge
		amount of personal information, including work details, wage slips,
		personal references, work references and previous addresses. Whilst
		there may be a valid reason for having to divulge such a large amount
		of personal information, it is very much a one-way process. The
		prospective tenant will be able to learn very little about the
		landlord/landlady and/or the rental agency.</p>
	<p>The purpose of this website is to help prospective tenants make
		more informed choices by sharing feedback on their own experiences
		with rental agencies.</p>
