    <p>According to the Australian Bureau of Statistic (ABS), almost
        one-third of households in Australia rent their homes. As a long-term
        renter in the Brisbane area I have experienced some very good service
        and some very poor service from rental agencies.</p>
    <p>An important part of the rental process is filling out the
        application form. Prospective tenants are required to declare a huge
        amount of personal information, including work details, wage slips,
        personal references, work references and previous addresses. Whilst
        there may be a valid reason for having to divulge such a large amount
        of personal information, it is very much a one-way process. The
        prospective tenant will be able to learn very little about the
        landlord/landlady and/or the rental agency.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to help prospective tenants make
        more informed choices by sharing feedback on their own experiences
        with rental agencies.</p>
